                    <p class="text">The very First thing I learned In my career Of coding<br>
                        When i was in Level 9 I fall in love with the beauty of HTML.<br>
                        And it Eventually opened the gate for learning Css and other things for me.<br>
                        There can be no competition of HTML-5 When It comes to Designing a Website.<br>
                        The most easiest and most Dynamic field.

                    <p class="text">Python is one of the easiest language i have ever learned<br>
                    It has the largest Libraries and Currently The most Popular Language.<br>
                    Basically i learned it while studing in Brac University.<br>
                    It is exactly Like Speaking English.<br>
                    To get familiar with Coding the very first thing you <br>
                    need to know is learing Logics.<br>
                    and Python Plays a vital role in that Sector.
